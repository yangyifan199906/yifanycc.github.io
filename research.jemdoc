=== Online Convex Optimization  
 In the context of Online Convex Optimization, the expert select a decision $x_t$ and get a loss   
$f_t(x_t)$ with respect to the loss function $f_t(\cdot)$ at each round. The aim of the Online Convex Optimization algorithm is to minimize the total loss over time $[1,T]$. \n\n
I'm interested in plenty of OCO algorithms, with a focus on the OCO algorithm with constraints.
 
=== Multi-armed Bandits
In probability theory, the multi-armed bandit problem (sometimes called the K or N-armed bandit problem) is a problem in which a fixed limited set of resources must be allocated between competing (alternative) choices in a way that maximizes their expected gain, when each choice's properties are only partially known at the time of allocation, and may become better understood as time passes or by allocating resources to the choice.\n\n
My research work focus on the Bandits algorithm with stochastic setting, where each arm of the Bandits follow a special distribution.
